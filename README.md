In the k-nearest neighbor algorithm, the determination of classes for test instances is usually performed via majority vote system, which may ignore the similarities among data. In this research, the researcher proposes an approach to fine-tune the selection of neighbors to be passed to the majority vote system through the construction of a random n-dimensional hyperstructure around the test instance by introducing a new threshold parameter. The accuracy of results, 80.7%, is compared to the accuracy obtained from the conventional k-NN algorithm, 77.2%, when performed on the Habermanâ€™s Cancer Survival Dataset.
